/**
 >> Javascript
 -- javaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language used for client-side scripting on the web. It’s primarily used to add interactivity to web pages, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

 -- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially called “Mocha,” it was later renamed to “LiveScript” and finally “JavaScript” due to trademark issues with Sun Microsystems, which owned the Java trademark.


 >> Feature 
-- Client-side scripting: JavaScript runs on the client-side (web browser), allowing for fast and efficient execution of code.
-- Dynamic: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime, rather than at compile time.
-- Interpreted: JavaScript code is interpreted by the browser, rather than compiled into machine code.
-- Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

>> Uses 
-- Web developement 
-- Client-side validations 
-- Game development 
-- Mobile and desktop applications
